            <h2>Amazon Clone</h2><br>
        
        <p>I've developed a frontend clone of Amazon, focusing solely on replicating the user interface without backend functionality. Using HTML and CSS, I recreated the layout, navigation, and visual elements of the original site. While the clone lacks backend features such as user authentication and product management, it serves as a showcase of my front-end development skills.</p>
